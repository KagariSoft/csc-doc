# Introduction

:::info

Some styles are not documented, they will be in due course.

:::

This is a styling framework based on the KagariSoft color palette. Also this Framework is based on Bootstrap.

The updates will be published little by little and will not follow a specific order, so some styles will not be prioritized, for example: Styles for the mobile version, or very specific styles.

This Framework plans to cover only the important and necessary tags, as well as necessary styles, on the other hand, this Framework is oriented to a 2 typography design, the japanese language and the western typography (english, spanish).
